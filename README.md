This project is exactly what it sounds like: a keychain that is also a PCB. I really wanted to make something small, fun, and tangible, and what better way to do that than turning a PCB into a keychain? It’s simple, it lights up, and it’s a tiny excuse to say “yeah, I designed this board myself” 😌 This is a USB-powered LED keychain made entirely from a PCB. When you plug it into a USB port, the LED turns on.
